# 📄 Bidi2pdfRails

**Bidi2pdfRails** is the official Rails integration for [Bidi2pdf](https://github.com/dieter-medium/bidi2pdf) – a
modern, browser-based solution for converting HTML to high-quality PDFs.  
It leverages headless browsing and offers a simple, flexible interface for PDF generation directly from your Rails
application.

> **⚠️ Note:** This project is currently **under development** and **not yet recommended for production use**.

## 🚀 Why Bidi2pdfRails?

- Utilizes modern browser technologies for accurate rendering (similar to `grover` or `wicked_pdf`)
- Easy to integrate into existing Rails projects
- Configurable options: URL, output path, rendering settings

gem "bidi2pdf-rails", github: "dieter-medium/bidi2pdf-rails", branch: "main"
gem "bidi2pdf", github: "dieter-medium/bidi2pdf", branch: "main"

# if you want a small performance boost, you can use the following:
# gem "websocket-native"

## 🧪 Example & Getting Started

You can find a full example inside the [`spec/dummy`](spec/dummy) directory of this repository.  
This demonstrates how to use `Bidi2pdfRails` in a realistic mini Rails application setup.

### Basic Usage

```ruby
# Render html via controller action `render_to_string`
# Any controller action:
def show
  render pdf: "invoice",
         template: "invoices/show",
         layout: "pdf",
         locals: { invoice: @invoice },
         print_options: { landscape: true },
         wait_for_network_idle: true,
         asset_host: "https://assets.example.com"
end

# Render pdf via direct url call
def show
  # See: PdfRenderer for all options
  render pdf: 'remote-report', url: "http://example.com", wait_for_page_loaded: false, print_options: { page: { format: :A4 } }
end

```
